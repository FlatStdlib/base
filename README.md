# Some Info

- The project is still in development!
- The library is a minimal C backend with a custom loader to link!
- Currently working on a machine code compiler to bind all FSL into a modernize C-like language in the future!

### Supported Architecture

- x86
- x86_64
- AMD
- RISC-V (Still in development)

Note: The only confirmed working architecture is x86 and x86_64. Mainly intel CPU!

### Install

Run the following commands to install the library!
```bash
sudo apt install git make -y
git clone https://github.com/FlatStdlib/Stdlib.git	# FSL-Stdlib
git clone https://github.com/FlatStdlib/fsl.git 	# FSL-GCC Toolchain
cd Stdlib
make # make tcc (for tcc (not complete, testing stage))
```

### Standard Use

```c
#include <fsl.h>

int entry() {
	println("Hello World");
	return 0;
}
```

# Compile w/ FSL

### Linux Linker
```c
Usage: fsl <c_file> <opt> <output>
Use --help for help or more arguments
```
