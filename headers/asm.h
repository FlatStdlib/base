/*
	- The core of clib+ - targets host cpu info & architecture functionality
	- For Host Architecture, The plan is to have ASM Lib for all syscall to follow
	  ABI standard like the current x86 and x86_64 ASM lib in 'src/asm/'
		+ TODO; Split this up into single header files for each architecture
		  and use this for macros only
	- Each architecture has the following definition for syscall

	MAX_REGISTER 		| Used for the amount of arguments ABI takes for syscall
	SYSCALL_REGISTER 	| Register for syscall number
	EXECUTE_SYSCALL		| Syscall Execution

	_SYS_NAME			| A leading _SYS_ for the name of syscalls, all syscalls
						| must match from each architecture to avoid having to make
						| future edits

	__REGISTER__		| Leading and ending double-underscore for register name(s)
						| optional to add more cpu register beyond what ABI requires
						| for external uses
